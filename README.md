# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis
This is an explorative analysis of an eletric vehicle data, Washington state.
# Brief Introduction
The electric vehicle population data of two main electric vehicles provided by the Department of Licensing: The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) - an all-electric vehicle using one or more batteries to store the electrical energy that powers the motor and is charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) - a vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor; uses another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source; and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source. So, recently, the Director of the Department hired me as a data analyst to help find some insightful information about the data.
## Brief Overview of the dataset
This dataset was made available on data.gov provided by the Department of Licensing, Washington state. It shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) information currently registered through the department. It consists of 125,000 rows and 17 columns.
## Problem Questions
*  What are the total number of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) registered?
*  Which state, city, and county had the highest number of registered BEV?
*  What are the model years of the vehicle?
*  Which model has the highest registered number of electric vehicle with the model year?
*  Who are the top 10 manufacturers of the electric vehicle?
*  What are the top 10 electric vehicle model?
*  What are the categories of the vehicle model for clean alternative fuel vehicle(CAFV) with their model year?
*  What is the the total number of vehicle categories by model for CAFV that are Eligible, Non-eligible, or unknown?
*  Which vehicle model with its electric type covers the highest electric range (miles) greater than 100miles per electric charge?
*  Which are the vehicle models that are not eligible for CAFV but can cover higher electric range?
*  What are the ranges for the lowest suggested retail price for the vehicle models with their model year and type by the manufacturers?
